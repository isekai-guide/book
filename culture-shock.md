# Culture Shock

If you find yourself falling into another world wherein other sapient lifeforms reside, chances are you're bound to experience quite a bit of culture shock. Unless you happen to have landed within the _Xanadu Bureaucracy of the Seraphim Incorruptible_, the residence of the new world you now inhabit are likely to hold various customs and beliefs that contradict your sensibilities, and possibly even go against your ethics and morality.

If you find yourself confronted with a civilization that still practices chattle slavery or have regular human sacrifices, you might be tempted to impose your modern ideals onto the barbarians. Assuming your transmigration has somehow netted you cheat-like powers, you might even find the idea of reforming the civilizations in question to be a simple task. But before you go about brute-forcing cultural shifts and possibly genociding some people, you should first gather information on the local culture, find out why they do what they do, determine if they have a good \(from their perspecitive\) reason for doing it, and then consider your options.

That said, while you're busy trying to kickstart a revolution, don't forget to take care of the dark overlord or evil dragon that you were brought to this world to take care of in the first place. The last thing you want is to emancipate the slaves, only for the big bad to stroll through and kill the newly reformed society.
