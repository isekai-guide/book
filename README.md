# Introduction to a Guide to Another World

So you've found yourself in another world?

Whether you've stumbled through a wardrobe, were wisked by a god or spacetime magic, or even died and retained your memories in the next life, this book will help you prepare for life in another world. Although no two transmigrations are identical, this guide hopes to help any would-be hero, overlord or adventurer that finds themselves trapped in another world, in hopes that they may survive, thrive and eventually provide feedback for how helpful this guide was.

Due to the diverse methods and processes of transmigration, one may find themselves in a situation where this guide may not be in reach to read at ones leisure, so I recommend giving it a thorough reading before you find yourself unwittingly wisked away without direction or the sense to make informed decisions.
